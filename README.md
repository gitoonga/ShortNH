# ShortNH

ShortNH is a PHP class used to Generate unique and short strings that work as reversible "hashes".
These "hashes" can in turn be used as temporary endpoints for an API (stored in Application Cache), sms/email unsubscribe links.
Please note that this is not a secure hashing algorithm and is intended to create shorter strings for use in links(at-least thats why i wrote it)
